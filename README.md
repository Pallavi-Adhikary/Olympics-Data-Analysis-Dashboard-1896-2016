# üèÖ Olympics Data Analysis Dashboard (1896 - 2016)

An interactive data analysis dashboard built using **Streamlit** that uncovers deep insights from **120+ years of Olympic history**. This project visualizes athlete trends, medal performances, gender participation shifts, and much more through rich, interactive visualizations.



##  Project Objective

To analyze historical Olympic data (1896‚Äì2016) and build an interactive dashboard that helps:

- Visualize medal tallies by country/year
- Track participation trends of athletes, nations, and sports
- Understand gender-based evolution and sport-wise age trends
- Enable dynamic country-level performance insights



##  Problem Statement

While Olympic data spans over a century, it's **underutilized** due to:
- Lack of accessible, centralized dashboards
- Manual and static reports offering limited insights
- No comparative sport/gender/country-based breakdowns

This project solves that by delivering a **clean, interactive dashboard** that makes Olympic data accessible and insightful.
